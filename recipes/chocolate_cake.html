    <h2>2 INGREDIENT NO BAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE (NO FLOUR, EGGS OR OIL)</h2>
    <i>
      This no bake chocolate cake tastes like a flourless chocolate cake, but
      you don’t need to do any baking. It is easy to make and doesn’t require
      flour, eggs, or oil. The cake comes out rich and chocolatey.
    </i>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>
      <li>Pumpkin Or Banana Puree</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips:</b> You can also use bittersweet chocolate
      chips if you don’t mind that your cake will be less sweet. Most of the
      sweetness is coming from the chocolate chips, so I prefer to use
      semi-sweet chocolate chips.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pumpkin or Banana Puree:</b> This recipe works with both pumpkin puree
      (a great way to use up some leftover puree) or banana puree (so you can
      make this cake all year long). If you use pumpkin, the cake will not be
      quite as sweet. You don’t really taste the pumpkin because the chocolate
      overpowers the pumpkin flavor. The cake has a bittersweet, rich chocolate
      flavor. You can use either canned or homemade pumpkin puree.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use banana puree, your cake will be sweeter. However, you will also
      taste the banana flavor. It will taste like banana and chocolate. If you
      are using banana puree, make sure you actually puree your bananas in a
      food processor or blender to remove all lumps. Just mashing is not enough.
      Also, make sure to use fresh bananas. Frozen bananas have too much water.
      Applesauce is not a good substitute for bananas in this recipe.
    </p>

    <h2>Cake Texture</h2>
    <p>
      This cake has a similar texture to a flourless chocolate cake. Of course
      it won’t taste exactly the same, but it is close. A flourless chocolate
      cake is made up mostly of chocolate and is rich and dense. This is like a
      chilled version of a flourless chocolate cake. If you decorate it with
      toppings like a chocolate ganache, it will taste even more like a baked
      dessert.
    </p>
    <h2>Cake Toppings</h2>
    <p>
      You can leave the cake plain though it will look a bit rustic. I don’t
      recommend sprinkling with powdered sugar because the powdered sugar gets
      absorbed by the cake. For this cake, I added a chocolate ganache. The
      ganache adds an even richer chocolate flavor.
