    <h2>One Tasty Veggie Lasanga</h2>
    <p>
      Seriously the best veggie lasagna! This lasagna recipe is packed with bell
      pepper, zucchini and carrots, sautéed until golden and tender on the
      edges. Recipe yields one 9-inch lasagna, enough for 8 slices.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <i>Veggies and spinach</i>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 large carrots, chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium zucchini, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>5 to 6 ounces baby spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Tomato sauce (or substitute 2 cups prepared marinara sauce)</i>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>¼ cup roughly chopped fresh basil + additional for garnish</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Remaining ingredients</i>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups (16 ounces) low-fat cottage cheese, divided</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>9 no-boil lasagna noodles*</li>
      <li>
        8 ounces (2 cups) freshly grated low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella
        cheese
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>
        To prepare the veggies: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the
        olive oil. Once shimmering, add the carrots, bell pepper, zucchini,
        yellow onion, and salt. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until
        the veggies are golden on the edges, about 8 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until
        the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach and cook until all
        of the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the
        heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, to prepare the tomato sauce: Pour the tomatoes into a mesh
        sieve or fine colander and drain off the excess juice for a minute.
        Then, transfer the drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add
        the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to
        an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later
        (you should have a little over 2 cups sauce). Rinse out the food
        processor and return it to the machine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it
        until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl.
        No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put
        it back onto the machine because you’ll need it later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the cooked veggies and spinach mixture to the bowl of the food
        processor. Pulse until they are more finely chopped (but not puréed!),
        about 5 to 7 times, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary.
        Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with the
        remaining cottage cheese, then add ¼ to ½ teaspoon salt (to taste) and
        lots of freshly ground black pepper. Stir to combine. Now it’s lasagna
        assembly time!
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread ½ cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9” by 9” baking
        dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles on top (snap off their ends to fit, and/or
        overlap their edges as necessary). Spread half of the cottage cheese
        mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with ¾ cup tomato sauce, then
        sprinkle ½ cup shredded cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with 3 more noodles, followed by the remaining cottage cheese
        mixture (we’re skipping the tomato sauce in this layer.) Sprinkle ½ cup
        shredded cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with 3 more noodles, then spread ¾ cup tomato sauce over the top
        (you may have a little sauce leftover) to evenly cover the noodles.
        Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup shredded cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap a sheet of parchment paper or foil around the top of the lasagna
        (don’t let it come into contact with the cheese). Bake, covered, for 18
        minutes, then remove the cover, rotate the pan by 180° and continue
        cooking for about 10 to 12 more minutes, until the top is turning spotty
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven and let the lasagna cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so it
        has time to set and cool down to a reasonable temperature. Sprinkle
        additional basil over the top, then slice and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      CHANGE IT UP: Feel free to play around with the vegetables here. You’ll
      want to use about 3 cups chopped veggies total (excluding the onion).
      Mushrooms or butternut squash might be nice!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Substitute gluten-free lasagna noodles. Choose
      no-boil (oven ready) noodles if possible; if not, cook them according to
      package directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAKE IT DAIRY FREE/VEGAN: Double the recipe for my vegan sour cream and
      use 2 cups instead of the cottage cheese. Skip the step where you would
      blend the cottage cheese and just barely blend the spinach/veggies into
      the sour cream. Omit the mozzarella and use all of the tomato sauce for
      the final layer. Serve the lasagna with a dollop of additional sour cream
      on top or basil pesto.
